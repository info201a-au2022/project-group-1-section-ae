## Summary

I'll write the dynamic paragraph here summarizing the data. "A well-written paragraph of summary information, citing at least 5 values calculated from the data. Each value should be presented professionally (see INFO-201 Style Guide). Here, the term "dynamic" means that the values are calculated dynamically."

The dataset used to analyze crime in the United States takes into account crimes that have occurred in every county in the United States. The crimes are categorized into violent crime and property crime. Violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, while property crime includes burglary, larceny theft, vehicle theft and arson. Crime data was recorded in the dataset from 2028 counties and broken down into the categories mentioned above.

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
