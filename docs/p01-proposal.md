### Date:
Autumn 2022

### Abstract:
Our main question about this project is how is crime different in certain areas? We would like to show crime that is nearby and also from the other side of the country which will give the reader some insight of what crimes are popular in different areas. This will also warn the reader of popular crimes in their area and stay clear of these crimes.

### Keywords:
federal crime; map; cities; calendar dates

### Introduction:
Our project will be a website that shows many different crimes which you will be able to filter to the crime that you want to see. You can filter out the city you would like to see and view how widely involved this crime is in that area. The user will also be able to control what date they would like to see the data being in, the earliest being the year of 2021 to give a more current timeline. They can filter the distance within the city they are looking at to show how zoomed in or zoomed out they want to see the data. We will be using variations of a color shade to show areas that have a hotter trend of crime and others that lay low with crime. There will be tabs to give other information about the project or information about crime.

### Problem Domain (400 words):
Project Framing:
This project will give an overview of property and violent crimes by area in the United States. Our focus will be crime in relation to its location. We hope to understand more about crime in relation to the different atmospheres of an area. We will do this by providing a map allowing the user to better understand the differences in amounts and types of crime depending on culture (i.e. cities compared to more rural areas). We hope to better understand the crime trends within the United States to allow for positive change.
Human values:
This project directly correlates to human ethics and what is considered “right” and “wrong”. Our project will include crimes ranging from property to violent crimes, meaning there is a wide range of the level of crimes. Many people attribute crime to different factors, including, but not limited to, “moral decline” and “poverty and inequality in society” (Halpern, 2001).  While this project will not work directly with ethics, crime is inherently rooted in doing what is considered “wrong” and the consequences offenders face after.
Stakeholders:
Direct Stakeholders:
The direct stakeholders are the victims of these crimes. They are directly impacted by every item stolen or wound they received. These crimes are done to them and directly impact their lives. They live with the effects. The direct stakeholders are also those who commit these crimes. They are directly affecting the crime because they are contributing to it.
Indirect Stakeholders:
The indirect stakeholders are the residents of locations where these crimes take place and the law enforcement. The residents with crime in their area are not directly impacted by the crime, but. Law enforcement are also indirect stakeholders because the crime does not affect them personally, but it is their job to deal with the aftermath of the crime. They arrive at the crime scene, write the reports and lock up the offender.
Possible Harms and Benefits:
	Benefits:
The benefits of this project is to inform people of the types of crime within their area. We hope this will provide greater awareness for the safety of certain areas and allow people to remain vigilant.
	Harms:
Crime is present all around us. With the world we live in today, that is an inescapable truth. This project could potentially cause hysteria and extreme fear (Näsi et. al, 2020).This hysteria is elevated when relating to violence (Beckett & Sasson, 2004) While it is important to be aware of your surroundings and remain safe, an obsession with crime can be unhealthy.


### Research Questions (50 words for each question):
* What types of crime are popular in big cities?

  In 2021, the most popular crime committed in big cities like the United States was property crime. Over 6.5 million offenses happened in one year just in the U.S. alone. Following that, the second most common is physical violence; at over 2.3 million cases of assault happening in one year.
* In what areas is crime at its lowest?

  As of 2020, Iceland keeps being the number one safest country in the world with the lowest crime rate at about 1.47 per 100,000 population. They keep it that way by having a larger country than population, no armed police officers, and staying equal between the people.
* In what area is there most crime? Does this affect those places?

  Crime is usually at its highest in urban areas rather than rural; property crime and theft being the highest. The reason behind this is because there are less chances of arrest and recognition due to the high population. This creates a more dangerous environment for the people that live there.


### Dataset (400 words):
Our dataset on all different types of crime is related to our problem domain to give viewers data on recent crime in their area. All aspects in our problem domain relate with crime and the data within it. Our data set includes various types of property and violent crime so the viewer is able to look through many different options. To our research questions, the dataset is directly related because we asked questions that will give us important values from the whole data. Using the dataset, we can extract certain numbers that will give us the highest or lowest value of specific categories. Which we can then use to answer questions like “What is the most popular crime?” “What is the least?”
This data was collected by the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) which is run by the FBI. The NIBRS was implemented in 1989 and has since been used to enhance the overall quality of data on crime incidents. While it does capture single crime incidents, the system is also engineered to collect separate offenses within a single incident. Not only that, but it collects information about the victim, known offenders, relationships between victims and offenders, arrested inviduals, and property involved in crimes. FBI’s NIBRS has provided greater specific information and data on crime incidents which will be beneficial for the public and for the bureau as well.
The data collection of the NIBRS was funded by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The most obvious beneficiary is the FBI and others who will most likely benefit from this funding could be civilians who need this data for projects, papers, or information. The FBI would benefit from this funding by being able to put in their data more efficiently and organized. There are NIBRS Service Tools which provide validation of an NIBRS information submission or validation errors. There are clear rules that are in place to validate each information that could influence future important factors. The Bureau of Justice Statistics seem to be in charge of the NIBRS, so it does look credible since it is from a governmental source. We obtained this data while looking through the design brief where there was a slide with multiple different data sets. We came to pick this dataset because a group member is going into the direction of cybersecurity hence the decision of a crime dataset. Yes, the source of this very informative and amazing dataset is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

### Expected Implications (150 words):
The expected implications are that our users who are reading the data on the website will be more aware of the crimes happening in different areas. The purpose of this project is to create a website that filters the crimes so the implication would be that users will have more knowledge in this area.  


### Limitations (150 words):
Some limitations that could occur in this project are bugs/glitches, lack of data, and ease of use. Bugs and glitches happen all the time on websites, apps, etc, so that is one thing that could set us back with this project. Second is lack of data where we won’t have enough data on crime to include on the website since not all crime is being recorded every day. Lastly is ease of use; one of the biggest issues that a UX designer has to keep in mind is how easy it is to use the product and navigate through it. That is one thing we have to keep in mind the most if we want the users of the website to be able to navigate it.
