### Date:
Autumn 2022

### Abstract:
Our main question about this project is how is crime different in certain areas? We would like to show crime that is nearby and also from the other side of the country which will give the reader some insight of what crimes are popular in different areas. This will also warn the reader of popular crimes in their area and stay clear of these crimes.

### Keywords:
federal crime; map; cities; calendar dates

### Introduction:
Our project will be a website that shows many different crimes which you will be able to filter to the crime that you want to see. You can filter out the city you would like to see and view how widely involved this crime is in that area. The user will also be able to control what date they would like to see the data being in, the earliest being the beginning of this year in 2022. They can filter the distance within the city they are looking at to show how zoomed in or zoomed out they want to see the data. We will be using variations of a color shade to show areas that have a hotter trend of crime and others that lay low with crime. There will be tabs to give other information about the project or information about crime.
